        [yellow::b]Nested Pages Container[::-]
        
        This demo showcases the [cyan]nested pages[::-] feature, which allows you to
        embed a pages container as a primitive within your layout.
        
        [green::b]Key Concepts:[::-]
        
        1. [yellow]Pages as Primitives[::-]
           The 'pages' type can be used as a nested primitive within flex/grid layouts,
           not just at the root level.
        
        2. [yellow]Multiple Content Areas[::-]
           Below, you can see a nested pages container with multiple pages loaded.
           The pages are defined in separate YAML files and referenced by name.
        
        3. [yellow]Use Cases[::-]
           • Tab-based interfaces within a section
           • Content areas that swap between different views
           • Sub-navigation patterns without leaving the current page
        
        [green::b]Limitation:[::-]
        Currently, navigation between nested pages requires custom implementation.
        The built-in {{ switchToPage }} function only works for root-level pages.
        
        [green::b]YAML Structure:[::-]
        
        type: flex
        items:
          - primitive:
              type: pages
              pages:
                - name: content1
                  ref: content1.yaml
                - name: content2
                  ref: content2.yaml
        
        The first page in the list is shown by default.
